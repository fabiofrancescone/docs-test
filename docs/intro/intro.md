- Directory services and user management
- Mobile synchronization (ActiveSync)
- Web and mobile interfaces
- Command-line and API-based administration

It is a comprehensive digital workplace platform designed to empower
organisations with digital sovereignty through a *secure*, *scalable*,
and *fully managed* on-premises solution. It provides a rich suite of
collaborative tools, seamlessly combining enterprise-grade email,
contacts, and calendars with modern collaboration features such as
real-time chat, video meetings, and document editing, representing a
reliable solution for enterprise business communication.

Built on an open-core architecture, offers complete control over data
and infrastructure, enhanced security, and smooth integration with
existing systems. Its enterprise-ready features, including *robust
backup*, *archiving*, *legal-hold* capabilities, and tools for
*regulatory compliance*, ensure effective data management and
sovereignty.

By leveraging the dynamic Mesh technology, administrators can easily
adapt the platform to meet both user and organisational needs, while
also enabling horizontal and vertical scaling to accommodate growing
resource demands. High availability and disaster recovery are ensured
through full redundancy and active replication, complemented by robust
security features including SAML and two-factor authentication (2FA).
